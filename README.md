# Worst Checkout Ever

The Worst Checkout Ever theme was create as part of a UX design project to design the worst UX interaction conceivable.

## Usage

The goal of this theme is modify the WooCommerce checkout experience in order to provide the worst experience possible. I would not recommend using this theme on a site that you actually want to be successful.

This theme requires the WooCommerce plugin and StoreFront theme to be installed in order to work.
